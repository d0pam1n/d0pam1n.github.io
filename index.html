                                         I love structure and order  and want to deliver high quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing software products. I like working in a team because you will learn faster and much more together.
                                         I am always open for new projects or challenges to create new things to make other peoeple happy.

                                 The goal is to have the same operating system on nearly all IoT devices. This would give us some important advantages:

                            <div>I was part of a bigger project with the goal to develop an All-In-One Software and Hardware Solution for process control of production machinery and edge capabilities.
                                 I was responsible for the conception and the development of the operating system to run the whole package. The final product is completely remote manageable,
                                 has its own remote firmware update mechanism and all additional user applications, that are pushed to the system, run separated in Linux container. 
                                 It is build with <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto</a> to integrate into CI/CD pipelines flawlessly.

                                 From the idea to the architecture over the software design and finally the development and integration, everything laid in my hands.
                                 The created platform is a resource-efficient, Go-based streaming platform for building event-driven apps. 
                                 The basic functionalities are comparable to <a href="https://nodered.org/">NodeRed</a> but with a more efficient and fast programming language. Thanks to <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a>.

                                The finance sector is a security relevant environment. As one of my most critical project while working at Sparkasse Bamberg,
                                I designed and developed a management solution that is able to scan the network traffic in realtime for new connected devices.
                                It is able to execute some actions if a new device is detected, like blocking the device, reporting it to the security team or switching it to a demilitarizied zone of the network.
                                The solution is based on the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/ITGrundschutz/ITGrundschutzStandards/ITGrundschutzStandards_node.html">standards of the BSI</a>.

                                      Back-End programming relies more on Java or Go. Whenever I need the most perfomance possible or when I work on embedded devices I obviously go with C/C++ or an other statically built language.
                                      If I want to automatize workflows or for some prototyping I use bash scripts, because they just work.

                    <div class="mb-3">In the past years of my working life a built up a lot of necessary soft skills required to survive the jungle.
                                      Started with small requirements engineering tasks I grow by building complex architecures for big software solutions and microservice communication flows.
                                      I worked with different teams using both, traditional project management and agile methodologies.

                    <div class="mb-3">"Use the right tool for the job" - That is true for programming languages but for the tooling around as well.
                                      Besides the typical state-of-the art developer tools like Git or Docker I got the chance for a deep dive into cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure in the last years.
                                      As an architect in software development projects you have to do some project management, so things like Jira or Confluence became my friends too.
